# KulkiJG
## Installation of the application (WINDOWS):
    1. Download latest version of the installer (https://jerzozwierz.itch.io/kulkijg)
    2. Run instaler_KulkiJG.exe
    3. Run program KulkiJG.exe
Typical problem: app can be stopped by Windows Smart Screen. In this case you need to click "More" and "Run anyway". Do not worry, this is just a result of me not having money to buy a certificate. Thus each version needs to build reputation with smart screen. I hope to aquire signing certificate in the future.

## Setup windows options:
    1. Number of particles
    2. Smoothing radius of SPH
    3. Gravity force
    4. Toggle obstacle swtich

## Controls inside the simulation:
### 1. Space bar - pause
    In pause menu one can see hashing cells and after clicking on particle it's neighbours
### 2. ESC - main manu
Controls of simulation parameters: density, viscosity, gravity etc.
What to display? (density, velocity)
Bucket (mouse interaction) menu
### 3. Left/right click - attract/repel particles
